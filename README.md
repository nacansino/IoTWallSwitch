# IoTWallSwitch
An open-source IoT Wall Switch based on ESP device. I based this project on Xoseperez's [espurna-board project](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna-board).

I aim this project to be a foundation of many small projects that ran on tap power supply.

Potential Applications:
- Generic Smart Switch for any load below 10A
- Mostly lights
- Small motors/fans/pumps
- Desktop/Laptop Charger
- Television
- Speakers
